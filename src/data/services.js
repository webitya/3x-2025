    description: `
      A. Manual Research
      1. Funding Signals
      - Recent VC/PE rounds, angel investments, or government grants.
      - Expansion announcements (press releases, news portals).
      2. Job Postings
      - Hiring sales, marketing, or tech roles = budget + expansion.
      - Senior hires = strategic shift.
      3. Operational / Process Complexity Signals
      - Rapid increase in SKUs, multiple service lines, or entering new markets.
      - Complex client onboarding (visible from case studies/testimonials).
      - Productivity analysis by analysing costs
      4. Social Engagement
      - Decision-makers engaging with competitor or solution-related content.
      - Liking/commenting on pain-point discussions.
      5. Company Talking About Pain Points
      - Leadership or employees openly discussing challenges in posts/comments.
      - Mentions in forums, industry groups, or press interviews.
      6. Attrition Signals
      - High churn in sales/marketing team (LinkedIn job changes).
      - Leadership exits = opportunity for new solutions.
      7. Growth Trends (3 Years)
      - Revenue growth trajectory, employee headcount, leadership behavior.
      8. Budget Analysis & Experiment Signals
      - Sponsoring events, ads, new tools adoption.

      B. Advanced Intent Verification – Outbound Touch Points
      Objective: Not to “sell” → but to validate buying intent through insight-driven outreach.
      - Light-Touch Email Campaigns (1–2 per month)
      - Intent Validation via Content Engagement
      - Micro-Surveys / Polls
      - Low-Touch Verification Calls
      Why This Matters:
      - Separates real-time buyers from good-fit accounts.
      - Builds evidence-based confidence.
      - Establishes channel credibility over 2–4 months.
